The joy of building has been coming back.

After 3.5 years working on a startup that we shutdown last year, and 20+ years in the industry, building software wasn't feeling fun anymore. I didn't want to touch a keyboard, let alone build something.

Then Claude Code with Opus 4 came out and I started using it to build some small side projects. The slog was replaced by a fascination with understanding this new type of computer and a new way of programming. I started to feel like a kid again, building things for the sake of it. 

I don't know where programming is going, but I know it's changing and I'm enjoying it again after a long time.
